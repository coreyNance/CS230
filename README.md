- <h3>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</h3>

<br>
    <h4>
    The client was a company called the Gamining room. They have an app game called Draw It or Lose It and wanted to develop a web-based version of the game.  The current development staff did not know how to set up the environment needed to develop this game as a web-based application. The requirements that are to be met are, a game that will have the ability to have one or more teams involved. Each team will have multiple players assigned to it. Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. Overall, the task was to advance and streamline the development of the web-based gaming app while keeping these requirements in mind.</h4>

-   <h3>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</h3>

<br>

<h4>
    With this design document, I found it difficult to pin point the exact areas to touch on.  If I was to pick an area I believe I did well on it would be the section explaining the server side, client and development tools used.  In this section I feel I very much understood the seperation between the client side, server side and what development tools can be used for the different platforms.

- <h3>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</h3>

<br>

<h4>
For the most part, this design document helped me better understand exact what the customer was looking for with the applicatian. This document also is very useful in helping me or the client understand what hardware will be a best fit for development and when it comes to developing the code, this document was very helpful in pinpointing on how and where security measures would take place.

- <h3>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</h3>

<br>
<h4>
The section that I would very much pick to revise would be the recommendation. Within my explinations, I tend to already think that the audience already has a baseline understanding of the basics.  A big example is when I made the recommendations under the Operating System Architectures, I talked about using a space saver type of architecture that would utilize multipe servers.  In order for this to work the absolute first step would be to have the application set up as a client - server.  My mistake was assumeing that at this point the application is already set up in this way but much needed revision would be starting from the basics of mentioning the very first step and then waling the audience through to my ultimate recommendation.

- <h3>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</h3>

<br>

<h4>
Assuming the typical user is like myself, which means that if the application is sluggish or I feel like my information is not protected, then I wont use it.  Its extremely important to take the user's needs into consideration because at the end of the day, they are the ones building value in the product. They will be intrusting this application to run smooth and effectivly as well as having securities built in for their protection.  In this design document, there are alot of explantions on how to have the application run efficiently by utilizing RAM storage over hard drive storage and for protection explantions focus on user authentication and sessions as well as building in different types of encryptions.  Having an effecient and secure application is usually the end goal.
